Question about using the path variable and difference between bashrc

## You

i`m installing pip in linux and got this error: WARNING: The scripts pip, pip3 and pip3.10 are installed in '/home/lucasgaldino/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
should i add into path

## Genie

Yes, you should add '/home/lucasgaldino/.local/bin' to your PATH environment variable. 

The PATH variable specifies the directories in which executable programs are located on the machine. When a command is entered in a terminal, the shell searches through these directories to find an executable program with that name.

To add '/home/lucasgaldino/.local/bin' to your PATH variable, you can add the following line to your .bashrc file:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/home/lucasgaldino/.local/bin
```

After adding this line, save and close the .bashrc file and then run the following command to apply the changes:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

This will update your PATH variable and allow you to use the pip command from anywhere in the terminal.

## Genie

Hello! Yes, you should add `/home/lucasgaldino/.local/bin` to your PATH in order to use pip and its associated scripts without having to specify the full path each time. You can do this by adding the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/home/lucasgaldino/.local/bin
```

To add `/home/lucasgaldino/snap` to your PATH as well, you can modify the above line like this:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/home/lucasgaldino/.local/bin:/home/lucasgaldino/snap
```

After saving the file, run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile` to apply the changes immediately.

why do i have 2 bashrc files? one on home and other on root

## Genie

The `.bashrc` file is a shell script that is executed whenever a new terminal session is started in an interactive mode. The file is specific to each user, and it is located in the home directory of that user. 

On the other hand, the `/root/.bashrc` file is the `.bashrc` file for the root user. This file is executed whenever you log in as the root user or switch to the root user using `su` command.

So, it's normal to have two `.bashrc` files - one in your home directory and another in the root directory. They are separate files for different users.
